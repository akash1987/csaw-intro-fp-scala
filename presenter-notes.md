# Presenter notes

## Agenda

- better grasp what is Functional Programming
- to create better programs
- through some example using Scala (not a pure FP prog lang but most concepts applies)
- look at Category Theory, won't do any math here :)
- will look only at the FP part of Scala

## What is FP ?

## Why

- notion of scope of execution, reasoning about code execution

## Immutability

- WORKSHEET: Immutablity
- impacts variable assignment

## Referential Transparency

- WORKSHEET: Referential Tranparency
- permit to reason about a function exclusively from its INPUT/OUTPUT

## Lazy Evaluation / Parallelization

## Pure Function / Side-effect

## Algebraic Data Type

- generally used to define precisely INPUT/OUTPUT of our program
